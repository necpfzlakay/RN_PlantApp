###  Necip FazÄ±l Akay
* Thanks for your review <3 
* I tried the show my knowledge.
* I also tried to take care of Structure, styling pixelling and readability. 
* It will necessarily contain errors or mistakes so I am open to feedback
* I used my own writing style, but with teamwork, more beautiful and sustainable structures can be created

* I have 3 core custom components for Text, Button and page layout. Those are increasing the coding speed but they could write better
